The ward has hit points equal to twice your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If the damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage. While the ward has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its magic remains. When you cast an Abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell slot used to cast that spell."
