Creating a BG3 Damage Calculator using Python and the Dear Pygui library.
The item "Database" (It's a formatted json...) was structered using the BG3 Item Index Cheat Sheet by Cayxx on r/Baldursgate3 (https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/16acy9l/bg3_cheat_sheet_for_items_in_each_act_spoilers/)
Right now you can calculate AC and get the item effects.

TODO:
- Integrate feats, racials, class spells;
- Spell, unarmed, class action and weapons manouver damage calculator.
